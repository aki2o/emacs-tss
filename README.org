    2013/08/10 Not yet available.  
    2013/09/08 It's available. But, master branch only.  
    
*** If use auto-install.el
    
    #+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(auto-install-from-url "https://raw.github.com/aki2o/emacs-tss/master/tss.el")
(auto-install-from-url "https://raw.github.com/aki2o/emacs-tss/master/typescript.el")

*** About official TypeScript.el

    [[http://www.typescriptlang.org/][The official site]] provides TypeScript.el for Emacs.  
    But the official Typescript.el has some trouble ( wrong syntax, have no hook ).  
    So, I have bundled typescript.el as modified version of the official TypeScript.el.

*** Modification from the official version

    #+BEGIN_SRC 
$ diff TypeScript.el typescript.el
66c66
< (declare-function ido-mode "ido" ())
---
> (declare-function ido-mode "ido")
486a487,491
> (defcustom typescript-mode-hook nil
>   "*Hook called by `typescript-mode'."
>   :type 'hook
>   :group 'typescript)
> 
3351c3356,3358
<     (font-lock-fontify-buffer)))
---
>     (font-lock-fontify-buffer))
> 
>   (run-mode-hooks 'typescript-mode-hook))
    #+END_SRC

    - It maybe happen that update of the official version is not merged into typescript.el
    - The last date of checking merge is 2013/08/10

      
* Configuration

  #+BEGIN_SRC lisp
;; If use bundled typescript.el,
(require 'typescript)
(add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.ts\\'" . typescript-mode))

(require 'tss)

;; Key binding
(setq tss-popup-help-key "C-:")
(setq tss-jump-to-definition-key "C->")
(setq tss-implement-definition-key "C-c i")

;; Make config suit for you. About the config item, eval the following sexp.
;; (customize-group "tss")

;; Do setting recommemded configuration
(tss-config-default)
  #+END_SRC
  
  
* Consideration

*** Activation

    If you meet the following condition, do not need to do anything.  

    - use bundled typescript.el
    - use =tss-config-default= setting

    Otherwise, need M-x =tss-setup-current-buffer= for activation in typescript-mode.  

    - Not activate on the buffer of the mode not included in =tss-enable-modes=

*** Deactivation by trouble at typescript-tools

    The function of this extension depends on typescript-tools.  
    And, typescript-tools may become impossible depending on the contents of the buffer.  
    If it happened, For avoiding Emacs performance degradation,  
    this extention is deactivated automatically and the following popup notification is shown.  

    [[file:image/alert.png][alert]]

    The above case is caused by the contents of the buffer.  
    So, typescript-tools maybe back to normal by activation after editing of the buffer.  
    If you want to activate this extension again, do M-x =tss-restart-current-buffer=.  

    Also, if you want to stop to use typescript-tools, do M-x =tss-stop-current-buffer=.

*** Reflection of the update of referenced path

    You can get the external definition using =/// <reference path ...=.  
    But typescript-tools can not find the update of that.  
    You have to do M-x =tss-reload-current-project=
    if you updated the external definition of current buffer.
